The repository is split in 3 folders:
- `site` is a template site for displaying jekyll-hackclub possibilities, it uses the plugin from the plugin folder and not the plugin from RubyGems
- `plugin` is the plugin that will be used by user in their jekyll site
- `server` is a Flask server for resolving id to name without needing user to have their own bot

Better documentation can be found in their respective folders
